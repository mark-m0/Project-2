Severe Weather Data

We aim to provide a complete data set composed of 2 different data elements. The first file of data looks at general weather events in the United States (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-weather-events). The second data set looks at US storm data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atinakarim/noaa-severe-storm-database?select=Storms_2015.csv). The goal is to have a data set representative of severe weather/storms. We will be cleaning this data using Pandas in a Jupyter Notebook. The Weather Event data will be limited down to severe weather events from 2017-2020 and the storm data will be limited to those events occurring between 2017 and 2020 as well. From here, the data will be loaded into MongoDB for search queries.
